# Image-Classification-Handwritten-Letters-Tensorflow-Keras
A Neural Network is constructed, using TensorFlow and Keras, to classify handwritten letters and predict the corresponding output class using the MNIST dataset

# Example

A neural network was created, trained and evaluateda using Tensorflow and Keras. 

Dataset of handwritten layers used : MNIST

Sample handwritten letter:
